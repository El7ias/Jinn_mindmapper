Jinn mindmapper: Road Map.



* All Maps need a title header in the UI so its easy to identify what this project is called and what its function is. 



Make top layer of ui/ux of Claude Code so mindmApper apps work directly with agent teams.

Able to spawn / que new jobs / CEO command Buttons: "bug audit and report". Project finished Audit. CFO Report. COO Report. CTO Report. 



Adding commerce Nodes - input user account data for 

* Shopify
* Meta / google adds
* google drive
* MCPs
* Community engineering, x,  facebook, discord, tiktok, youtube, WhatsApp, etc.
* Customer demographic scraper / google sheets / engine / campaign
* API credentials
* GitHub repositories credentials



Mindmapper should have this information cued up for when Claude requires that information but not overload the project prompt with all data at once. Project master prompt streamlining should optimize for best performance at all times, let MindMapper be a go to resource for further instructions when needed. 





end instructions: 

I want the team to do a deep dive audit of their work, find bad code and optimize, dead code and remove non-destructively, report ghost code, find bugs, errors and fix. report findings
